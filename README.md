# TASK3
(SVM) to classify images of cats and dogs
classifying images of cats and dogs using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). 🐱🐶✨

Here’s a glimpse into what I did:

Dataset Preparation: I utilized the Kaggle dataset for cats vs. dogs, preprocessing and resizing images to ensure consistency. 📂

Feature Extraction: Flattened the images into 1D arrays to feed into the SVM model, allowing for efficient classification. 📊

Model Training: Trained the SVM model with a linear kernel to distinguish between cats and dogs. 🧠

Evaluation: Assessed the model’s performance, achieving an accuracy score that demonstrates the effectiveness of SVM in image classification tasks. ✅

Visualization: Visualized some test images alongside their predicted and true labels for insightful analysis. 📈

This project enhanced my skills in machine learning and image processing, and I’m grateful to Prodigy InfoTech for this amazing opportunity! 🙌
